# Pre-GE
A simple plugin which disables actions related to the Grand Exchange.
### Disabled Actions
- Grand Exchange clerk: *Talk-to, History, Sets, Exchange*
- Grand Exchange booth: *Exchange*

*Collect is left enabled.*

### Wasn't this called "Rune Man"?
Yes. The name and icon was reverted to stay true to its roots.
